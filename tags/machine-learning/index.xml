      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve seen a lot of deep building algorithms run maybe on our system and on the Cloud, but there&#39;s
something magical to getting these algorithms. Maybe a model that we&#39;ve trained to run in your hand, on
our smartphone or on a lightweight embedded processor like, an Arduino Raspberry Pi. TensorFlow Lite, an
exciting technology that allows us to put our models directly and literally into people&#39;s hands.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the existing things about JS is that it allows us to do neural network training and inference right
there in the web browser. So, itâ€™s really cool that a user can upload a picture to a web browser or grab an
image from a webcam and then have a neural network do training or inference right in the web browser
without needing to send that image up to the cloud to be processed by a server.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
